👨‍💻 I am embedded software developer working on core elements like bootlaoders, driver, firmware.

⚡ I am also a front end and back end developer for web and mobile platforms.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on software or hardware development projects ranging from a simplest firmware to complex game development.
